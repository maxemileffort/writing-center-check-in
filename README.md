### Writing Center Check-in

Sign in page: localhost:8080/

Waitinglist for checked-in students:  localhost:8080/queue

Technology used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node

This project arose from my wife wanting to start a writing center at the school that she works at. I volunteered to help her tackle record keeping
and waitlisting students that arrive. That way, if teachers wanted records of which of their students were using this service, they could see that,
as well as what was being talked about and the degree to which it was helping their students.
